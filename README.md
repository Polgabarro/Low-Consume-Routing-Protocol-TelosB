# Low-Consume-Routing-Protocol-TelosB
**A test of a low consume protocol for the platform TelosB**

The objetive about this work is implement a routing protocol that allow to improve the battery consumption for the wireless sensors. For justify the development of this protocol, first of all will analize the state of the art of the platforms of sensor monitoring that are more used nowadays. Then we will analize the operative system for microcontrollers TinyOS and we will explain the theoretical and practical operation of the protocol.
To end the implentation of protocol and their performance is analyzed.
